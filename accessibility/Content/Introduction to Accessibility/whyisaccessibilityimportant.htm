                                        <h1>Why is Accessibility Important?</h1>
                                        <h2>&#160;</h2>
                                        <h2>What is the Point of Accessibility?</h2>
                                        <p>The point of accessibility is to make sure that products or environments are able to be used by everyone. It is nearly impossible to make everything perfect for all users, but designers should strive to make their content as inclusive as possible. Those with disabilities greatly benefit from accessibility, and accessible features are also convenient for those without a disability. People should not be held back by the failures of society, since that gives them a disadvantage compared to those who may be considered as the average person.</p>
                                        <p>According to author Laura Kalbag, accessibility can be considered as a form of inclusion. Accessible designs do not “make the objects less usable for those without the particular impairments they address - in fact, they usually make a product easier for everyone to use.” (Kalbag Chp. 1). For example, Kalbag explains how pivoting handles allow for everyone to have easier access to a space. If you are holding a lot of stuff, it is much easier to push down and out on a pivoting handle, versus grabbing a spherical door knob with your entire hand, and turning it. The second option requires you to have a firm grip of the doorknob, which is inaccessible for people with mobility disabilities, and for people holding a lot of stuff in their arms. So by making this feature accessible, it is inclusive for everyone.</p>
                                        <p>When creating a design that is digitally accessible, the designer must consider the needs of everyone. They need to first follow the WCAG Guidelines, and do their best to reach the highest rating. The conformance levels are A (lowest), AA (mid range), and AAA (highest). The WCAG website states that it “does not recommend that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content” (WCAG Standards &amp; Best Practices). The goal should be to have a website be rated AA, with efforts to get it close to AAA. It is very difficult to get the highest rating, but that doesn’t mean that a designer shouldn’t at least attempt to get there.</p>
                                        <p>Personas can also help designers create accessible products. These are characters that are created based on real studies in order to help designers connect with those who need accessible technology.</p>
                                        <p>When creating videos, including subtitles should be the standard. Subtitles are helpful to everyone. For deaf people, it allows them to receive the information from the video. It is also helpful for those who simply process information better while reading. Video subtitles on websites like YouTube are present, but not on all of their videos. The company needs to improve their captioning technology in order for it to be easier for creators to add captions to their videos.</p>
                                        <p>Digital accessibility matters because everyone should have the ability to access the same information. This allows everyone to have the same opportunities in life, and to not be held back by society’s failures to adapt to their needs.</p>
                                        <h2>&#160;</h2>
                                        <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                                        <p>According to Ronald L. Mace, universal design is “the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.”</p>
                                        <p>The key difference between universal design and accessible design is that universal design is made so everyone has the same experience. An example of accessible design is a scenario where a wheelchair user would like to enter a building. The building has steps in the front, but it does have a ramp! However, the ramp is located all the way in the back of the building, and the wheelchair user needs to roll past the dumpsters and into a back entrance. While they do gain access to the building, it is not the same experience as a person who is able to use the stairs in the front.</p>
                                        <p>Universal design allows for everyone to use the same entrance. An example of this is a combined ramp and stairs. This helps everyone: maybe there is a mother pushing her baby in a stroller. A ramp would allow her and her child easier access into the building. Maybe there is an elderly man, who finds it painful to walk up stairs. Now he has access to the ramp as well, without the need for a separate back entrance.</p>
                                        <p>When applied to web design, Laura Kalbag uses the example of changing the text size of a website. It is accessible design to have an option at the top of the page to change the text size, but it is universal design if you just make the text bigger to begin with.</p>
                                        <p>If a designer creates a product with universal design in mind, the result will give everyone the same experiences. If everything is designed with this concept in mind, then everyone will have the same opportunity to succeed in society, since the world has adapted to their needs.</p>
